# Artificial intelligence course final project
The final project of this course was to implement othello game with minmax AI.
The GUI has been written using java Swing game and we used MVC design pattern that helped a lot in keeping our project clean and readable.
The game logic has been written inside the board class and can viewed there. 
For the main part of our project that is the creation of minmax tree and pruning using alpha beta and implementing a heuristic for depth limited min max.
Further improvments were then added to reduce the width of our search tree
